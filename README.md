# JS_Example_simpletooltip
> Standard, CSS-based and Javascript-based degrading tooltips

This example shows several examples of tooltips, implemented using browser standard attributes, gracefully degrading CSS (for better styled tooltips) and gracefully degrading Javascript (for better control on the tooltip behaviour).

## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://webengineering-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 23rd lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

Simply download the code and open the provided html file in your browser.
